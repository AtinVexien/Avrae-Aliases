	"C": "A confused creature is affected immediately for the following 3 rounds of initiative. During this time, it loses its ability to take reactions and moves at half speed. When a Confused Pokémon attempts to use an action or bonus action on their turn, they must first roll a d20. On a result of 10 or lower, the Pokémon hurts itself for an amount of typeless damage equal to their proficiency modifier and forfeits their remaining action and bonus action to the trainer for the rest of the turn. On a roll of 16 or higher, the status ends immediately.",
	"Pa": "A paralyzed creature has disadvantage on any STR or DEX saving throws and moves at half speed. When a paralyzed Pokémon begins its turn, it must first roll a d4. On a result of 1, the Pokémon is incapacitated and restrained until the beginning of their next turn and must forfeit their remaining action and bonus action to their trainer. If a creature is paralyzed and confused/asleep, the paralysis roll comes first. If it fails, it does not roll to wake or be confused. (Electric types are immune to this status condition)",
	"B": "A burned Pokémon rolls all damage rolls twice and takes the lower result (this bypasses and does not cancel out with things like Savage Attacker, Iron Fist, Weather, etc). In addition, the creature takes an amount of damage equal to its proficiency bonus at the beginning of each of its turns until it faints or is cured of its burns. (Fire types are immune to this status condition)",
	"Po": "A poisoned creature has disadvantage on all ability checks and attack rolls, and takes an amount of damage equal to its proficiency bonus at the end of each of its turns until it faints or is cured of its poison. (Poison and Steel types are immune to this status condition)"
